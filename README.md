# SQL-project-Customer-analysis
In this Sql file, I explored the customers' food preferences, campaigns responses, and developed views, some stored programs etc.
The dataset been extracted from kaggle and has multiple columns to work with to get insights into customers' product preferences,purchase channel choice and their reponses across company campaigns.
Intially I created mutliple tables from the metadata of the dataset in the excel and loaded into MySQL workbench for the analysis.
